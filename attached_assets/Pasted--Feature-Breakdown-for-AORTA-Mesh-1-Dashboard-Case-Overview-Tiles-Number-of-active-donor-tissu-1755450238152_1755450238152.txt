🔑 Feature Breakdown for AORTA Mesh™
1. Dashboard

Case Overview Tiles: Number of active donor/tissue/organ cases, flagged discrepancies, audits pending.

Recent Activity Feed: Timestamped log of latest actions (e.g., new consent uploaded, temperature deviation flagged).

Quick Access Panel: Direct links to most recently opened Case Passports.

Alerts & Notifications: Real-time compliance alerts (missing fields, abnormal temperatures, expired consent forms).

2. Case Passport

Unified Case Record: A digital “folder” that contains all data and documents tied to a single donor, organ, or tissue lot.

Tabs:

Documents → Upload/view PDF, Word, images.

Smart Forms → Structured clinical & regulatory data.

Chain-of-Custody → Time-stamped transfer history.

Audit Binder → Export-ready compliance package.

Metadata Panel: Donor ID, case ID, type (organ vs. tissue), case status (active, in QA, released).

Access Control: Grant/revoke viewing rights instantly, with expiration timers.

3. Smart Forms

Dynamic Form Builder: Auto-generates forms based on jurisdiction (FDA, AATB, EU directives).

Field Validations: Real-time error prevention (e.g., “Signature required,” “Temperature must be 2–8°C”).

Conditional Logic: Only shows fields relevant to donor type, recovery method, or region.

Version Control: Automatic versioning when standards change, with audit trail.

4. QA Workbench

Discrepancy List: All flagged issues ranked by severity (critical, major, minor).

Inline Document Preview: Highlighted errors in uploaded forms (e.g., missing initials on consent form).

Resolution Workflow: Options to approve, reject, or request correction.

AI-Assisted Review: Suggests fixes (e.g., missing DOB detected → autofill from other docs).

Audit Trail of QA Decisions: Tracks who resolved what, when, and why.

5. Chain-of-Custody

Event Timeline: Recovery → Processing → Storage → Distribution/Implant.

Cold Chain Tracking: Manual entry + IoT sensor integration for temperature logs.

Role-Based Signoffs: Every custody change requires digital signature & timestamp.

Tamper-Evident Ledger: Append-only, cryptographically signed events.

6. Audit Binder

One-Click Export: Generates PDF binder containing all required regulatory documents.

Auto-Include Proofs: Chain-of-custody log, consent verification, donor screening, QA resolutions.

Regulation Templates: Preconfigured for FDA, AATB, UNOS, or EU standards.

Immutable Timestamping: Each export is time-stamped and locked.

7. Interoperability & Connectors

EHR Integration: FHIR/HL7 import/export.

Lab System Connector: Auto-ingest lab results (serologies, NAT testing).

Courier APIs: Real-time logistics status (pick-up, in transit, delivery).

OCR Import: Legacy paper/PDF intake converted into structured fields.

Label/UDI Generator: Auto-generate compliant tissue/organ labels with barcodes/QR codes.

8. Consent & Authorization Manager

eConsent Capture: Digital consent forms with patient/family signature capture.

Multi-language Support: Consent forms auto-translate with legal text preloaded.

Identity Verification: Optional photo ID capture or biometric confirmation.

Revocation Tracking: Consent withdrawal instantly cascades to all stakeholders.

9. Security & Privacy

Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit.

Access Control: Role-based + attribute-based (e.g., “lab can see test results, not identity”).

Scoped Data Sharing: Temporary, purpose-specific access tokens.

Data Residency Controls: Choose where data is stored (US, EU, etc.).

Full Audit Logs: Every action (upload, view, share, export) is logged immutably.

10. Admin & Analytics

Metrics Dashboard: Error rates, case volumes, audit readiness score.

User Management: Add/remove coordinators, QA officers, auditors.

Custom Rules Engine: Org-level rules (e.g., “flag if donor age > 65 for corneas”).

Reporting Tools: Export operational KPIs (turnaround time, defect rate).

✅ In short: This program would not just replace PDFs and spreadsheets — it would create a universal case passport system with real-time compliance intelligence, global interoperability, and instant audit readiness.
