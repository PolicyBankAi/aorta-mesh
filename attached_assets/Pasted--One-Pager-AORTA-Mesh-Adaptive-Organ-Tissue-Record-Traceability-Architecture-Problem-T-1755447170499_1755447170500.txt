üìÑ One-Pager: AORTA Mesh‚Ñ¢

Adaptive Organ & Tissue Record & Traceability Architecture

‚∏ª

Problem

Tissue banks and transplant organizations struggle with fragmented data, inconsistent documentation, and compliance risk. Critical workflows depend on paper forms, faxed records, and siloed databases, making audits, case matching, and global traceability inefficient and error-prone.

‚∏ª

Solution

AORTA Mesh‚Ñ¢ is a web-based, federated platform that creates a portable, verifiable ‚ÄúCase Passport‚Äù for every donor, organ, and tissue lot. It unifies documentation, automates compliance checks, and ensures instant, secure sharing across OPOs, tissue banks, labs, carriers, and hospitals worldwide.

‚∏ª

Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Case Passport: Cryptographically signed bundle of donor/tissue/organ records, sharable with scoped access.
	‚Ä¢	Smart Forms: Policy-aware, dynamic forms that prevent missing/invalid fields.
	‚Ä¢	QA Workbench: AI + rules engine that detects gaps, anomalies, or mismatches before audits.
	‚Ä¢	Chain-of-Custody Graph: Append-only log from recovery ‚Üí storage ‚Üí processing ‚Üí distribution.
	‚Ä¢	Audit Binder: One-click compilation of regulatory-ready binders with immutable proofs.
	‚Ä¢	Interoperability Layer: Connects with EHR, LIS, lab systems, UNOS, courier APIs, and labeling systems.

‚∏ª

Benefits
	‚Ä¢	70% fewer post-facto documentation errors (caught at point-of-entry).
	‚Ä¢	50% less duplicate data entry across systems.
	‚Ä¢	Audit prep time cut from weeks ‚Üí hours.
	‚Ä¢	Global compliance readiness (FDA, AATB, UNOS, GDPR, EU directives, etc.).

‚∏ª

Target Users
	‚Ä¢	Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)
	‚Ä¢	Tissue Banks & Eye Banks
	‚Ä¢	Transplant Centers & Hospitals
	‚Ä¢	Labs & Courier Networks

‚∏ª

Business Model
	‚Ä¢	Per-case or per-lot pricing (scalable with volume).
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise licensing for unlimited nodes.
	‚Ä¢	Connector marketplace for labs, EHRs, and courier integrations.
	‚Ä¢	Compliance subscription for regulatory mapping updates.
