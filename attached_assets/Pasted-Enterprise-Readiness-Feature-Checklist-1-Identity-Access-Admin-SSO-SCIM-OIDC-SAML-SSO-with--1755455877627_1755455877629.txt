Sandbox & Contract Tests: Public sandbox tenancy; published OpenAPI; backward-compatibility contract tests.

FHIR/HL7 at Scale: Async ingest with ACK/NACK; message reprocessing UI; mapping diffs versioned per partner.

Courier & IoT: Device certificate management (mTLS), enrollment flows, calibration metadata store; offline cache + delayed upload.

7) Product Features for Enterprise Workflows

Four-Eyes Approval: Dual sign-off for critical actions (binder release, consent revocation, ledger edits).

Queue Management: Work queues by role (QA, Intake, Audit) with SLAs, aging, escalation rules.

Bulk Operations: Bulk share, bulk label, bulk binder compile; CSV import wizard with field mapping templates.

Advanced Search: Field, date, geo, and free-text across cases/docs/events; saved searches with shareable links.

Tasking & Notes: Case-scoped tasks, @mentions, and resolution checklists with timestamps.

Watermarking & Classification: Visual banners (Internal/Restricted/External), watermark with user/time/case on all previews/exports.
